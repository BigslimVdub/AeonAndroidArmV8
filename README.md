# AeonAndroidArmV8
This repo holds the binaries of Aeon CLI built on Ubuntu 18.10 with Docker for Android ArmV8.

The current Binaries are based off the latest 12.8 and upstream Merge 3 from Stoffu. 

Build instructions will be added when time permits. 

I have not personally tested these as I have no root access on Oreo 8.0 on my device. Please give feedback if they work.
