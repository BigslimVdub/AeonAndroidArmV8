# AeonAndroidArmV8
## This repo holds the binaries and how-to build of Aeon CLI built on Ubuntu 18.10 with Docker for Android ArmV8.

The current Packaged Binaries are based off the latest v0.12.9.0 release and docker build. 

Build instructions are found [here](https://github.com/BigslimVdub/AeonAndroidArmV8/blob/master/Build_and_Deploy.md). 

I have personally tested these and they work using ADB when placed in the /data/local/tmp directory. 

Please give feedback if they work on your device. Files are executables that must be fun from either ADB shell or a Terminal Emulator on your device. 

It is recommended at least 2gb ram for best function on your device. Testing on Galaxy S7 works good. Approximately 200 blocks per 10 seconds sync time on recent block sizes with standard sync. 

Have fun living the Aeon Lifestyle on your device!
