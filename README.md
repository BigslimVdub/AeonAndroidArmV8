# AeonAndroidArmV8
This repo holds the binaries and how-to build of Aeon CLI built on Ubuntu 18.10 with Docker for Android ArmV8.

The current Binaries are based off the latest v0.12.8.0 and upstream Merge 3 from Stoffu. These will be in the official v0.12.9.0 release when it is released to the public.  

Build instructions are found [here](https://github.com/BigslimVdub/AeonAndroidArmV8/blob/master/Build_and_Deploy.md). 

I have not personally tested these as I have no root access on Oreo 8.0 on my device. Please give feedback if they work. Files are executables that must be fun from either ADB shell or a Terminal Emulator on your device. 

It is recommended at least 2mb ram for best function on your device. 

Have fun living the Aeon Lifestyle on your device!
